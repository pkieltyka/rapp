This file acts as a bundler for all variables/mixins/themes, so they
can easily be swapped out without `core.scss` ever having to know.

For example:

@import './variables/colors'
@import './variables/components'
@import './themes/default'

// Some best-practice CSS that's useful for most apps

  margin: 0;
